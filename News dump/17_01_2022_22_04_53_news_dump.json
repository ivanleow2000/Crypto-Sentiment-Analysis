So often seen tweeting about cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, the 50-year-old billionaire doesn't shy away from sharing memes that most professionals pause in a strict corporate environment. It's no secret that posting something \"controversial\" on the microblogging platform could even get you fired. It's an old classic debate that old Internet users like to reiterate, 'talk without consequence.' Therefore, Musk has turned this fiasco into a meme with this clever phrase that some may even consider a warning.The latest meme he shared has a Twitter image with the text, \"get fired from your job in five to ten years.\" It also adds, \"say something you want.\" Although it's not easy to figure out, you might be reminded of the childhood lesson, \"think before you speak.\" What makes this tweet more interesting is Musk's own comment that he shares, \"Good thing I never tweet anything controversial.\"Good thing I never tweet anything controversial pic.twitter.com\/T7sD1q1hvd\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 16, 2022 According to a Twitter poll, it's a mockery as the CEO of Tesla recently got into trouble after he decided to sell some of his Tesla stock. Tesla investor David Wagner had sued Musk for allegedly violating agreements with the US securities regulator. The US regulator even sued him in 2018 after joking about Tesla's privatization. The accusations allege that Musk's tweets manipulate Tesla's share prices on the stock market.He also came under fire from some cryptocurrency enthusiasts after calling the new Internet buzzword 'Web3' 'BS.' In simple words, Web3 is the evolution of the 'world wide web,' which now includes blockchains. being mere audience or uploaders In his old tweet, he stated that Web3 is \"more of a marketing buzzword than reality right now.\" However, he seems to believe that Web3 will be a reality in the future, but we're not quite there yet.","pubDate":"2022-01-17 09:59:52","full_description":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/assets.thehansindia.com\/h-upload\/2022\/01\/17\/500x300_1195252-elon.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia"},"1":{"title":"This is the next big company with massive plans for the metaverse","link":"https:\/\/www.tweaktown.com\/news\/84031\/this-is-the-next-big-company-with-massive-plans-for-metaverse\/index.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"There is a new company on the horizon that is preparing for a big step into the world of cryptocurrency and the Metaverse.

Singapore is a popular location for cryptocurrency companies due to a comparatively clear regulatory and operating environment and is among the forerunners globally in developing a formal licensing framework. But the city-state's authorities have repeatedly warned that trading in digital payment tokens (DPT), or cryptocurrency, is highly risky and not suitable for the general public, as they are subject to sharp speculative swings. The new guidelines clarify the expectations of MAS that companies should not engage in marketing or advertising of DPT services in public areas in Singapore or through the engagement of third parties, such as social media influencers, to promote DPT services to the general public. They can only market or advertise on their own corporate websites, mobile applications or official social media accounts. \"MAS strongly encourages the development of blockchain technology and innovative application of crypto tokens in value-adding use cases,\" Loo Siew Yee, MAS Assistant Managing Director (Policy, Payments and Financial Crime), said in a statement. \"But the trading of cryptocurrencies is highly risky and not suitable for the general public. DPT service providers should therefore not portray the trading of DPTs in a manner that trivialises the high risks of trading in DPTs, nor engage in marketing activities that target the general public.\" \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2022 .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }","image_url":"https:\/\/i.gadgets360cdn.com\/large\/bitcoin_crypto_marlet_cap_pexels_small_1639375288384.jpg","source_id":"ndtv"},"3":{"title":"Homegrown TikTok rival Chingari raises $15 million in new funding","link":"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/homegrown-tiktok-rival-chingari-raises-dollar15-million-in-new-funding\/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Bengaluru-based short video platform Chingari said the funds will be used, among others, to strengthen the backend technology team, as well as boost its marketing initiatives for 2022.","content":"<article> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/in\/news\/regional-content-drives-indian-short-form-video-apps-to-tiktok-levels\">Chingari<\/a>, which claims to have 32 million active users making it the most popular social media app in the country, has announced that it has raised $15 million in a Series A extension round. <\/p><p>Seen as India's answer to the now banned TikTok, the short video platform Chingari said it would use the funds to launch new in-app features and also strengthen its back-end technology and team.<\/p><p>Chingari is planning to unveil live-streaming, socio-commerce and audio chat features on its platform shortly.

Based on trademark documents the retail giant filed in December 2021 with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the company is also laying the groundwork to create its own cryptocurrency to contend with the likes of Bitcoin and Ether. This isn't the first time we've heard rumblings from Walmart related to the crypto market, but if things do turn out the way it seems, we could see crypto adoption in the retail segment shoot through the roof. According to CNBC , Walmart filed seven trademarks in late December 2021 that appear to indicate the retailer's intent to both make and sell virtual goods while a separate filing indicated that the company would be offering users virtual currency and NFTs . The documentation states, among other things, that Walmart may launch \u201cfinancial services, namely, providing a digital currency and a digital token of value for use by members of an online community via a global computer network.\u201d Walmart , as expected, hasn't provided any details about its plans, instead telling CNBC in a generic statement that it is \u201ccontinuously exploring how emerging technologies\u201d may impact its business. The company went on to say that it tests \u201cnew ideas all the time,\u201d and that some of them may become actual products and\/or services. Meanwhile, another application also details possibilities for \"physical fitness training services\" as well as classes in the field of health and nutrition. According to a report by The Verge , these applications could take place via augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) environments. The company also made another filing for the use of its name and logo in both AR and VR. A separate article by Bloomberg pointed out that the company had also filed trademarks for certain names like \"Verse to Curb,\" \"Verse to Home,\" and \"Verse to Store\" \u2014 all hinting that the company could be preparing a virtual shopping experience for its customers. Walmart's trademark application also shows that they might make software's in the future. These software suites can be used in e-commerce marketplaces in mobile\/game devices and can also be used for fund transfers, blockchain, crypto, and other similar uses. In the near future, whatever virtual world Walmart plans to open its store in will push the price of its token while being a big push for all stakeholders in the metaverse space. The release of its cryptocurrency means Walmart might even start accepting Bitcoin across all its stores in the US.","image_url":"https:\/\/i.gadgets360cdn.com\/large\/walmart_reuters_small_1555051156927.JPG","source_id":"ndtv"}},"nextPage":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"4":1,"5":1,"6":1,"7":1,"8":1,"9":1}}
