Singapore is a popular location for cryptocurrency companies due to a comparatively clear regulatory and operating environment and is among the forerunners globally in developing a formal licensing framework. But the city-state's authorities have repeatedly warned that trading in digital payment tokens (DPT), or cryptocurrency, is highly risky and not suitable for the general public, as they are subject to sharp speculative swings. The new guidelines clarify the expectations of MAS that companies should not engage in marketing or advertising of DPT services in public areas in Singapore or through the engagement of third parties, such as social media influencers, to promote DPT services to the general public. They can only market or advertise on their own corporate websites, mobile applications or official social media accounts. \"MAS strongly encourages the development of blockchain technology and innovative application of crypto tokens in value-adding use cases,\" Loo Siew Yee, MAS Assistant Managing Director (Policy, Payments and Financial Crime), said in a statement. \"But the trading of cryptocurrencies is highly risky and not suitable for the general public. DPT service providers should therefore not portray the trading of DPTs in a manner that trivialises the high risks of trading in DPTs, nor engage in marketing activities that target the general public.\" \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2022 .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }","image_url":"https:\/\/i.gadgets360cdn.com\/large\/bitcoin_crypto_marlet_cap_pexels_small_1639375288384.jpg","source_id":"ndtv"},"6":{"title":"Animoca, Galaxy Interactive and Polygon back gaming firm nCore in web3 push","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/17\/animoca-galaxy-interactive-and-polygon-back-gaming-firm-ncore-in-web3-push\/","keywords":["Asia","Funding","Gaming","Mobile","Animoca Brands","Galaxy Interactive","Polygon"],"creator":["Manish Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"nCore Games has raised $10 million in a new financing round as the top Indian gaming firm gears up to launch web3 offerings, its top executives said Monday.

Animoca Brands and Galaxy Interactive, two high-profile investors in the crypto space, led the funding. Polygon, a popular layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution, and Hyperedge Capital also participated in the round. Scores of angel investors including Amitabh Singhal, Sandeep Nailwal, Kanwaljit Bombra, Sohil Chand, Ashish Chand, Ram Madhvani, Rakesh Kaul, Mannan Adenwala, Sanjay Narang, Taj Haslani, Kristian Segerstrale, Sanjay Gondal, Vedant Baali, Kartik Prabhakara, Peter Leung, Yashraj Akashi and Akshay Chaturvedi also invested in the round. nCore Games houses a number of gaming studios including Studio nCore, Dot9 Games, and IceSpice. Its portfolio includes multiplayer action-title Fau-G and Pro Cricket Mobile that have garnered tens of millions of downloads. IceSpice, additionally, today houses a number of third-party games on its platform. The startup plans to launch and invest in more games this year, said Vishal Gondal, co-founder of nCore Games, in an interview with TechCrunch. But the bigger focus with the funding is expansion into the metaverse, he said. nCore Games is evaluating launching its own NFTs and tokens and may do so in the next few months, he said. India has emerged as one of the largest mobile games markets globally by download counts. PUBG Mobile, before it was banned by New Delhi, had amassed over 50 million monthly active users in India. But gaming firms have struggled to efficiently monetize this user base because of low-penetration of in-app purchases and small ticket advertising dollars. Gondal, an industry gaming veteran who sold his previous venture to Disney, said there\u2019s a shift in the gaming economy, especially in the developing markets where firms have largely relied on advertisement to generate revenue. He cited the popularity of Axie Infinity in the Philippines, a market similar to India where in-app purchase revenue is not high. Drawing parallels between India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, Gondal said he is optimistic that web3 offerings that have made inroads in several categories and in many markets will prove popular with gaming in India. Gondal said web3 is positioned to enable the right incentive structure to all stakeholders. \u201cCurrently when you\u2019re playing a game, the maximum upside for you was to become part of some community. Now while you\u2019re playing the game, you also have the chance to own the value of the game,\u201d he said. Tejraj Parab, the chief executive of IceSpice, said nCore Games is eyeing making a universal token that all of its games as well as those of the partner firms will provide to the community. The startup is also hoping to make its technology available to other game developers to leverage, he said. Dayanidhi MG, the chief executive of Studio nCore, said, \u201cwe are excited to embrace the emerging trends and technologies in the company of global leaders and highly successful funds, companies and veterans to take nCore to the next level with exponential growth.\u201d Web3 is beginning to gain traction in India. Indian startup Faze, backed by Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India, last year partnered with ICC, the global governing body of cricket, to launch NFTs for cricketers. The startup is currently holding talks to raise a new financing round from Insight Partners, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Several Bollywood celebrities have also partnered with firms to launch their own NFTs. \u201cnCORE Games was started by experienced gaming industry professionals with strong pedigrees. This is one of our most promising investments in India, which has a large gaming market with a massive growth potential,\u201d said Yat Siu, the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, in a statement. \u201cnCORE Games has the right team to leverage blockchain and NFTs in games to deliver digital property rights to players, and we look forward to many successful products as we move toward a global open metaverse.\u201d","pubDate":"2022-01-17 08:53:48","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"techcrunch"},"7":{"title":"Singapore curbs crypto marketing in digital asset crackdown - The Block Crypto","link":"https:\/\/news.google.com\/__i\/rss\/rd\/articles\/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJsb2NrY3J5cHRvLmNvbS9saW5rZWQvMTMwNDU3L3NpbmdhcG9yZS1jdXJicy1jcnlwdG8tbWFya2V0aW5nLWluLWRpZ2l0YWwtYXNzZXQtY3JhY2tkb3du0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYmxvY2tjcnlwdG8uY29tL2FtcC9saW5rZWQvMTMwNDU3L3NpbmdhcG9yZS1jdXJicy1jcnlwdG8tbWFya2V0aW5nLWluLWRpZ2l0YWwtYXNzZXQtY3JhY2tkb3du?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Singapore curbs crypto marketing in digital asset crackdown\u00a0\u00a0The Block CryptoCryptocurrency service providers should not promote their services to public, says MAS as it warns of 'high risks'\u00a0\u00a0CNAMAS stops crypto service providers from marketing to general public\u00a0\u00a0The Edge SingaporeSingapore Central Bank Warns Crypto Firms Against Promoting Services\u00a0\u00a0MarketWatchView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 08:53:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},"8":{"title":"Homegrown TikTok rival Chingari raises $15 million in new funding","link":"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/homegrown-tiktok-rival-chingari-raises-dollar15-million-in-new-funding\/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Bengaluru-based short video platform Chingari said the funds will be used, among others, to strengthen the backend technology team, as well as boost its marketing initiatives for 2022.","content":"<article> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/in\/news\/regional-content-drives-indian-short-form-video-apps-to-tiktok-levels\">Chingari<\/a>, which claims to have 32 million active users making it the most popular social media app in the country, has announced that it has raised $15 million in a Series A extension round. <\/p><p>Seen as India's answer to the now banned TikTok, the short video platform Chingari said it would use the funds to launch new in-app features and also strengthen its back-end technology and team.<\/p><p>Chingari is planning to unveil live-streaming, socio-commerce and audio chat features on its platform shortly.

The app supports more than 20 Indian regional languages, in addition to English and Hindi. Chingari recently launched a crypto token \u2018$GARI' to make content monetisation more mainstream in the country. The cryptocurrency is built on the Solana blockchain, and is expected to enable content creators to monetize their videos, allowing them to earn income from the Chingari app. They can also set up their own e-commerce spaces. The token will likely facilitate the sale of physical merchandise and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Chingari and allow fans to fund their favorite artists. The Bengaluru-based startup said it is the first social network in India to issue crypto tokens.","image_url":null,"source_id":"techradar"},"9":{"title":"Bitcoin price prediction: Which crypto will explode in 2022?
