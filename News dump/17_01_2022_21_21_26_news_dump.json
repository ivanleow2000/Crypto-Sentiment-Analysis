Understandably, it has become a rather controversial asset class, with smart people arguing for and against it. Even so, no one can deny the wealth this emerging asset class has created. In the last year alone, the crypto market has skyrocketed 109% to $2.1 trillion. However, enthusiasm for more speculative assets has waned in recent months as high inflation and the prospect of rising interest rates have driven investors to look for safer alternatives. To that end, despite tremendous gains in the past year, the crypto market currently sits 29% below its all-time high. Here's the silver lining: Every past downturn has proved to be a buying opportunity , and there are dozens of cryptocurrencies worth owning. For instance, Cardano ( CRYPTO:ADA ) and Fantom ( CRYPTO:FTM ) look like smart-long term investments. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Cardano Cardano is a programmable blockchain powered by the ADA token, which currently ranks as the seventh-most-valuable cryptocurrency. In 2015, the project was started by Charles Hoskinson shortly after he left Ethereum ( CRYPTO:ETH ) . Cardano aims to be a better version of Ethereum, and it differentiates itself in three ways. First, the developer team has taken an academic approach to building the blockchain. Rather than rushing to complete the platform, the Cardano project was divided into five phases, focusing on the foundation, decentralization, smart contracts, scalability, and governance. Moreover, the team frequently submits research papers for academic peer review, taking an evidence-based approach to development. Second, Cardano is secured by an eco-friendly proof of stake consensus protocol known as Ouroboros. In that system, validators stake tokens to ensure their honesty, as that stake will be forfeited in the event of fraud or an attempted attack. Unlike proof of work consensus, where miners compete based on computing power, Ouroboros randomly selects validators to add new blocks to the chain, thereby securing the network with reduced energy consumption. Third, the upcoming fourth phase of development -- expected to begin in late 2022 or 2023 -- will feature Ouroboros Hydra, a scaling solution that will add multiple side chains to the core blockchain. In other words, Hydra will add additional blockchains to the platform, dividing network traffic more efficiently. In turn, Hydra will boost throughput from its current 250 transactions per second (TPS) to a theoretical 1 million TPS. That would make Cardano one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain platforms, and maybe even the top performer. So what's the investment thesis? Cardano has roots in peer-reviewed academic research. Its Ouroboros consensus protocol is energy efficient and highly scalable. As of Sept. 12, 2021, smart contracts are live on the blockchain, meaning an ecosystem of dApps and decentralized finance (DeFi) services should blossom in the near future. However, those products aren't free. Users pay transaction fees using the blockchain's native cryptocurrency. In other words, as dApps and DeFi products on Cardano become more popular, demand for ADA should rise, pushing its price higher. 2. Fantom Fantom brands itself as a high-throughput smart contracts platform for digital assets and dApps. The project aims to resolve two key limitations frequently found in other blockchains: a lack of scalability and a lack of interoperability. To do that, Fantom relies on a unique proof of stake consensus mechanism known as Lachesis, a protocol that allows validators on the network to calculate the time order of events independently. That means each node (computer) can achieve consensus without waiting for confirmation from every other node. In turn, that makes Fantom very fast. In fact, Fantom can handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), and those transactions are finalized in about one second. For perspective, Ethereum -- the largest dApp and DeFi ecosystem by a wide margin -- can handle about 14 TPS and it takes six minutes for those transactions to reach finality (i.e. be incorporated into the blockchain). That means Fantom is far more scalable than Ethereum, which could help it take market share. Furthermore, Fantom is also compatible with Solidity, the programming language used to build smart contracts on Ethereum. That means developers can easily port their Ethereum-based dApps over to the Fantom blockchain, where performance is better and fees are lower. Not surprisingly, developers and investors have taken note, and Fantom actually ranks as the sixth-largest DeFi ecosystem, with over $7.1 billion invested on the platform. Going forward, as Fantom-powered dApps and DeFi products become more popular, rising demand for FTM tokens should drive its price higher. That's why this cryptocurrency looks like a smart long-term investment .","image_url":null,"source_id":"fool"},"1":{"title":"Vitalik Buterin Asks Twitter Followers Which Crypto They Prefer to Overtake Ethereum \u2014 Cardano, Tron Favorites","link":"https:\/\/news.bitcoin.com\/vitalik-buterin-crypto-twitter-currency-prefer-overtake-ethereum-cardano-tron\/","keywords":["Altcoins","Bitcoin","Cardano","crypto replace ethereum","crypto replacing ethereum","tron","Vitalik Buterin","Vitalik Buterin poll","Vitalik Buterin poll cryptocurrency poll"],"creator":["Kevin Helms"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin set up a pair of polls on Twitter asking his followers if 80% of all transactions and savings in the year 2035 are in one currency and it is not ether, which currency they would prefer it to be.

These tokens showed 24-hour gains of 2.5%, 4.0%, and 3.2%, respectively, as of 11:00am ET. Over the past seven days, each of these tokens remains in the green, between 3% and 5% higher. Of course, Bitcoin saw its worst start to the year since its inception, making this rebound week an important one for traders to watch. Image source: Getty Images. Cardano continues to gain ground, following this week's news that the Cardano Forest, a project run by the Cardano Foundation, hit a major milestone of planting 1 million trees. So what These moves among top tokens Bitcoin and Ethereum come as trading volumes settle down. According to recent reports, capital inflows into the crypto sector have waned to start the year. This has meant that expectations are that volatility could pick up, once buying or selling pressure returns to more normalized levels. The Ethereum Foundation keeps working towards the next step of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which will move the system over to a proof-of-stake architecture while scaling up transaction speeds and lowering gas fees. Bitcoin is starting to look like a reliable alternative to gold and other traditional value stores. This week, investment bank Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) argued that the digital currency could be worth $100,000 per token over the next five years. For Cardano, a top proof-of-stake network aiming to become carbon-negative, it was certainly big news this week when the blockchain network announced that it had inspired 1 million trees to be planted. This Foundation is aiming at planting 1 billion trees in a bid to become the greenest blockchain network, and one devoted to helping solve the climate crisis. Given the negative publicity many top cryptocurrencies have received for energy consumption and carbon emissions, this is a big differentiating factor for Cardano. Now what The crypto market appears to be taking a breather, with lower trading volumes suggesting these top tokens may be increasingly viewed as longer-term investments, rather than speculative trading vehicles. For those taking the long view of the crypto sector, that's perhaps a good thing. However, indications are that should volumes pick up again, volatility could be on the rise. For those taking one side of the bet on any of these tokens over the near term, that's something to consider.","image_url":null,"source_id":"fool"}},"nextPage":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null}}
