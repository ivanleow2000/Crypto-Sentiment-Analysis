Animoca Brands and Galaxy Interactive, two high-profile investors in the crypto space, led the funding. Polygon, a popular layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution, and Hyperedge Capital also participated in the round. Scores of angel investors including Amitabh Singhal, Sandeep Nailwal, Kanwaljit Bombra, Sohil Chand, Ashish Chand, Ram Madhvani, Rakesh Kaul, Mannan Adenwala, Sanjay Narang, Taj Haslani, Kristian Segerstrale, Sanjay Gondal, Vedant Baali, Kartik Prabhakara, Peter Leung, Yashraj Akashi and Akshay Chaturvedi also invested in the round. nCore Games houses a number of gaming studios including Studio nCore, Dot9 Games, and IceSpice. Its portfolio includes multiplayer action-title Fau-G and Pro Cricket Mobile that have garnered tens of millions of downloads. IceSpice, additionally, today houses a number of third-party games on its platform. The startup plans to launch and invest in more games this year, said Vishal Gondal, co-founder of nCore Games, in an interview with TechCrunch. But the bigger focus with the funding is expansion into the metaverse, he said. nCore Games is evaluating launching its own NFTs and tokens and may do so in the next few months, he said. India has emerged as one of the largest mobile games markets globally by download counts. PUBG Mobile, before it was banned by New Delhi, had amassed over 50 million monthly active users in India. But gaming firms have struggled to efficiently monetize this user base because of low-penetration of in-app purchases and small ticket advertising dollars. Gondal, an industry gaming veteran who sold his previous venture to Disney, said there\u2019s a shift in the gaming economy, especially in the developing markets where firms have largely relied on advertisement to generate revenue. He cited the popularity of Axie Infinity in the Philippines, a market similar to India where in-app purchase revenue is not high. Drawing parallels between India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, Gondal said he is optimistic that web3 offerings that have made inroads in several categories and in many markets will prove popular with gaming in India. Gondal said web3 is positioned to enable the right incentive structure to all stakeholders. \u201cCurrently when you\u2019re playing a game, the maximum upside for you was to become part of some community. Now while you\u2019re playing the game, you also have the chance to own the value of the game,\u201d he said. Tejraj Parab, the chief executive of IceSpice, said nCore Games is eyeing making a universal token that all of its games as well as those of the partner firms will provide to the community. The startup is also hoping to make its technology available to other game developers to leverage, he said. Dayanidhi MG, the chief executive of Studio nCore, said, \u201cwe are excited to embrace the emerging trends and technologies in the company of global leaders and highly successful funds, companies and veterans to take nCore to the next level with exponential growth.\u201d Web3 is beginning to gain traction in India. Indian startup Faze, backed by Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India, last year partnered with ICC, the global governing body of cricket, to launch NFTs for cricketers. The startup is currently holding talks to raise a new financing round from Insight Partners, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Several Bollywood celebrities have also partnered with firms to launch their own NFTs. \u201cnCORE Games was started by experienced gaming industry professionals with strong pedigrees. This is one of our most promising investments in India, which has a large gaming market with a massive growth potential,\u201d said Yat Siu, the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, in a statement. \u201cnCORE Games has the right team to leverage blockchain and NFTs in games to deliver digital property rights to players, and we look forward to many successful products as we move toward a global open metaverse.\u201d","pubDate":"2022-01-17 08:53:48","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"techcrunch"},"1":{"title":"You Can Buy The Largest Diamond Ever Auctioned\u2014A 555 Carat Black Gem\u2014With Crypto (Photos)","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/carlieporterfield\/2022\/01\/17\/you-can-buy-the-largest-diamond-ever-auctioned-a-555-carat-black-gem-with-crypto-photos\/","keywords":["Business","\/business","Business","\/business","Breaking","breaking-news","consumer","consumer"],"creator":["Carlie Porterfield"," Forbes Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"The diamond is estimated to fetch as much as $6.8 million.","content":"The diamond is estimated to fetch as much as $6.8 million.","pubDate":"2022-01-17 08:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/thumbor.forbes.com\/thumbor\/fit-in\/0x0\/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29\/https:\/\/specials-images.forbesimg.com\/imageserve\/61e1bef919b97d285efff303\/0x0.jpg?cropX1=0&cropX2=4414&cropY1=467&cropY2=2951","source_id":"forbes"},"2":{"title":"Singapore cbank issues guidelines to discourage crypto trading by public","link":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/singapore-cbank-issues-guidelines-discourage-073651982.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 07:36:51","image_url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/20mcaPYWhA2Gv8sso4.4Hw--~B\/aD01MjY7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/reuters.com\/a7802cba61d7f50f025776faf6fcc98b","source_id":"yahoo"},"3":{"title":"GemUni Disrupts Crypto Gaming With the Decentralized NFTs Gaming Platform for Play to Earn","link":"https:\/\/news.bitcoin.com\/gemuni-disrupts-crypto-gaming-with-the-decentralized-nfts-gaming-platform-for-play-to-earn\/","keywords":["Press release","GemUni"],"creator":["Bitcoin.com Media"],"video_url":null,"description":"PRESS RELEASE.

This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard rumblings from Walmart related to the crypto market, but it is the most exciting development thus far. BigTunaOnline\/Shutterstock The trademark discovery was made by CNBC , which reports that Walmart filed its trademarks with the UPSTO on December 30, 2021. The documentation states, among other things, that Walmart may launch \u201cfinancial services, namely, providing a digital currency and a digital token of value for use by members of an online community via a global computer network.\u201d Walmart, as expected, hasn\u2019t provided any details about its plans, instead telling CNBC in a generic statement that it is \u201ccontinuously exploring how emerging technologies\u201d may impact its business. The company went on to say that it tests \u201cnew ideas all the time,\u201d and that some of them may become actual products and\/or services. Despite the dismissive comments, Walmart\u2019s trademark paperwork hints at big plans behind closed doors \u2014 and this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard about the company potentially dabbling in cryptocurrency. In August 2021, Walmart published a job advertisement that sought a senior director for digital currencies. The language used in that job listing fueled speculation that Walmart may be exploring cryptocurrency as a payment option. photo_gonzo\/Shutterstock In one set of documents, Walmart also revealed potential plans to get into the non-fungible token (NFT) market, though it\u2019s unclear how that may play out. Though they remain controversial and their future unknown, NFTs have skyrocketed in popularity, tying artwork and other digital content to the blockchain in a way that makes them \u201ccollectibles.\u201d More often than not, NFTs are pieces of artwork that are sold on select platforms for an amount paid in cryptocurrency. The buyer acquires the NFT and becomes the owner of the digital creation. However, many companies have embraced this blockchain tech as a way to offer promotional items. For example, DC offered free NFT collectibles to fans who attended its FanDome 2021 event. Meanwhile, the NFL teamed with Ticketmaster to give certain game attendees a commemorative version of their tickets in NFT form. It\u2019s possible Walmart may offer free NFTs as promotional items, but it\u2019s also possible the company may have bigger plans, going so far as to sell tokens in the same way retailers used to sell sports cards.","image_url":null,"source_id":"slashgear"},"8":{"title":"\u2018AWS for Web3\u2019 Pocket Network Shakes Up Infrastructure of the Internet","link":"https:\/\/news.bitcoin.com\/aws-for-web3-pocket-network-shakes-up-infrastructure-of-the-internet\/","keywords":["Press release","Pocket Network"],"creator":["Bitcoin.com Media"],"video_url":null,"description":"PRESS RELEASE.
