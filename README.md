Using news APIs for sentiment analysis and price predictions

Technical analysis may not be the best indication of future prices due to the speculative nature of cryptocurrency. It is better, in my view, to have an easy and quick method of processing news relating to crypto and act on it quickly.   

Yes, there will be better scripts and bots out there that exploits this first-mover advantage. However, having this process of getting a sentiment score quickly still provides an advantage over those who have to take the time to search and read through multiple news articles from multiple sources. This will allow for the effects of the price lags which arise due to the average news reader's slower rate of information processing, to be capitalised.

Of course, research has to be done regarding when most news sources release their articles, or if there is even a fixed time.
