Animoca Brands and Galaxy Interactive, two high-profile investors in the crypto space, led the funding. Polygon, a popular layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution, and Hyperedge Capital also participated in the round. Scores of angel investors including Amitabh Singhal, Sandeep Nailwal, Kanwaljit Bombra, Sohil Chand, Ashish Chand, Ram Madhvani, Rakesh Kaul, Mannan Adenwala, Sanjay Narang, Taj Haslani, Kristian Segerstrale, Sanjay Gondal, Vedant Baali, Kartik Prabhakara, Peter Leung, Yashraj Akashi and Akshay Chaturvedi also invested in the round. nCore Games houses a number of gaming studios including Studio nCore, Dot9 Games, and IceSpice. Its portfolio includes multiplayer action-title Fau-G and Pro Cricket Mobile that have garnered tens of millions of downloads. IceSpice, additionally, today houses a number of third-party games on its platform. The startup plans to launch and invest in more games this year, said Vishal Gondal, co-founder of nCore Games, in an interview with TechCrunch. But the bigger focus with the funding is expansion into the metaverse, he said. nCore Games is evaluating launching its own NFTs and tokens and may do so in the next few months, he said. India has emerged as one of the largest mobile games markets globally by download counts. PUBG Mobile, before it was banned by New Delhi, had amassed over 50 million monthly active users in India. But gaming firms have struggled to efficiently monetize this user base because of low-penetration of in-app purchases and small ticket advertising dollars. Gondal, an industry gaming veteran who sold his previous venture to Disney, said there\u2019s a shift in the gaming economy, especially in the developing markets where firms have largely relied on advertisement to generate revenue. He cited the popularity of Axie Infinity in the Philippines, a market similar to India where in-app purchase revenue is not high. Drawing parallels between India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, Gondal said he is optimistic that web3 offerings that have made inroads in several categories and in many markets will prove popular with gaming in India. Gondal said web3 is positioned to enable the right incentive structure to all stakeholders. \u201cCurrently when you\u2019re playing a game, the maximum upside for you was to become part of some community. Now while you\u2019re playing the game, you also have the chance to own the value of the game,\u201d he said. Tejraj Parab, the chief executive of IceSpice, said nCore Games is eyeing making a universal token that all of its games as well as those of the partner firms will provide to the community. The startup is also hoping to make its technology available to other game developers to leverage, he said. Dayanidhi MG, the chief executive of Studio nCore, said, \u201cwe are excited to embrace the emerging trends and technologies in the company of global leaders and highly successful funds, companies and veterans to take nCore to the next level with exponential growth.\u201d Web3 is beginning to gain traction in India. Indian startup Faze, backed by Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India, last year partnered with ICC, the global governing body of cricket, to launch NFTs for cricketers. The startup is currently holding talks to raise a new financing round from Insight Partners, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Several Bollywood celebrities have also partnered with firms to launch their own NFTs. \u201cnCORE Games was started by experienced gaming industry professionals with strong pedigrees. This is one of our most promising investments in India, which has a large gaming market with a massive growth potential,\u201d said Yat Siu, the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, in a statement. \u201cnCORE Games has the right team to leverage blockchain and NFTs in games to deliver digital property rights to players, and we look forward to many successful products as we move toward a global open metaverse.\u201d","pubDate":"2022-01-17 08:53:48","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"techcrunch"},"1":{"title":"Top cryptocurrency news on January 17: The biggest moves in Bitcoin, NFTs and more","link":"https:\/\/www.moneycontrol.com\/news\/business\/top-cryptocurrency-newsjanuary-17-the-biggest-movesbitcoin-nftsmore_15923381.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A daily round-up of the most interesting articles on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether to help jump-start the day","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 04:17:49","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"moneycontrol"},"2":{"title":"Cryptocurrency Prices Today: Bitcoin, Ethereum down","link":"https:\/\/www.moneycontrol.com\/news\/business\/cryptocurrency-prices-today-bitcoin-ethereum-down_15923321.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Bitcoin#39;s price is currently above Rs 34 lakh, and its dominance over other cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours is 39.35 percent","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 04:08:29","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"moneycontrol"},"3":{"title":"Cryptocurrency Prices Today: Bitcoin, Ethereum down","link":"https:\/\/www.moneycontrol.com\/news\/business\/cryptocurrency-prices-today-bitcoin-ethereum-down_15923301.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Bitcoin#39;s price is currently above Rs 34 lakh, and its dominance over other cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours is 39.35 percent","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 04:08:29","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"moneycontrol"},"4":{"title":"Boxing Legend Mike Tyson Says He\u2019s \u2018All in\u2019 on Solana Crypto \u2014 Asks Fans How High SOL Will Go","link":"https:\/\/news.bitcoin.com\/boxing-legend-mike-tyson-all-in-on-solana-crypto-how-high-sol-will-go\/","keywords":["Altcoins","bitcoin vs solana","ethereum vs solana","Mike Tyson","Mike Tyson Bitcoin","Mike Tyson crypto","Mike Tyson crypto investment","Mike Tyson cryptocurrency","Mike Tyson investing in sol","Mike Tyson investments","Mike Tyson sol","Mike Tyson solana","SOL","Solana"],"creator":["Kevin Helms"],"video_url":null,"description":"Boxing legend Mike Tyson, aka \u201cIron Mike,\u201d says he is \u201call in on solana.\u201d He is now asking his Twitter followers how high the price of the cryptocurrency SOL will go.

The cryptocurrency was down 5.7% over the previous 24-hour period as of 11:45 a.m. ET. With Bitcoin and Ethereum roughly flat over the previous day of trading and the broader cryptocurrency market looking uncharacteristically stable, Dogecoin's sell-off likely stems from investors taking profits after recent gains. The token began climbing early in the week and posted even bigger gains after Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that his electric-vehicle company would accept DOGE as payment for its merchandise. Now, the popular meme cryptocurrency seems to be taking a breather. Image source: Getty Images. So what Over the last year, Elon Musk has been a Dogecoin holder's best friend. The famous executive has hinted at, and directly expressed, support for the token through Twitter messages and other channels, and his comments have frequently powered impressive gains for the meme-powered cryptocurrency. Even with the recent pullback, Dogecoin is still up roughly 19% over the last seven days. After Musk published a Tweet on Jan. 14 announcing that Dogecoin could be used to purchase Tesla merch, the token's price quickly spiked 25%. While there doesn't appear to be any coin-specific news behind the cryptocurrency's pullback on Sunday, it's not surprising to see Dogecoin give up some ground on the heels of the recent pop. Now what Dogecoin trades down roughly 75% from the lifetime high that it hit last May. Yet, even after recent volatility in the broader cryptocurrency space and substantial draw downs for its token price, the cryptocurrency is still up roughly 1,900% over the last year. Dogecoin Price data by YCharts Dogecoin was started as a campy, dog-themed clone of Bitcoin, but the token went on to deliver seriously impressive returns for investors who got in before its massive pricing surge. The token currently has a market capitalization of roughly $23.6 billion and ranks as the 11th largest cryptocurrency by valuation. While Ethereum, Solana , and Cardano have underlying blockchain service networks that help shape the performance of their respective cryptocurrencies, the pricing drivers for Dogecoin are currently limited to coin adoption and speculation. If more companies begin accepting the token as a payment method or more trading platforms introduce the option to buy and sell the cryptocurrency, that could help to send Dogecoin higher. However, investors should proceed with the understanding that Dogecoin is a high-risk investment, and its trading will likely continue to be highly volatile.","image_url":null,"source_id":"fool"},"8":{"title":"$2.5 Billion in NFT Sales This Week, Volume Climbs 161%, Meebits NFT Sales Surge","link":"https:\/\/news.bitcoin.com\/2-5-billion-in-nft-sales-this-week-volume-climbs-161-meebits-nft-sales-surge\/","keywords":["Markets and Prices","blockchains","Cryptophunks V2","cryptoslam.io","ETH sales","Ethereum","Flow sales","looksrare","LOOT","Meebit #13824","Meebit #9711","Meebits collection","NBA Top Shot","nft","NFT buyers","NFT sales","NFT sellers","NFTs","Non-fungible Token","Opensea","ronin","Solana","ten blockchains","Theta","Wax Blockchain"],"creator":["Jamie Redman"],"video_url":null,"description":"During the last seven days, there\u2019s been $2.53 billion non-fungible token (NFT) sales, up 161% over the past week.
