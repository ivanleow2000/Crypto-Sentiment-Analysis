With a dip of 0.57 percent, each token of Bitcoin is trading at $46,214 (roughly Rs. 34.2 lakh) on Indian exchange CoinSwitch Kuber. On international exchanges as well, Bitcoin has suffered similarly marginal price loss. The world's oldest cryptocurrency is trading at around $42,500 (roughly Rs. 31.6 lakh) on global exchanges such as CoinMarketCap and Binance. Along with Bitcoin's failure to gain, Ether has also registered losses. Ether is trading at $3,532 (roughly Rs. 2.62 lakh) per token. According to Gadgets 360's crypto price chart , Ether incurred a loss of 1.40 percent and dropped in value from its previously closing price of $3,582 (roughly Rs. 2.65 lakh). Ripple , Polkadot , Dogecoin , and Shiba Inu among a bunch of other popular altcoins also witnessed price lows, following Bitcoin and Ether. The market momentum has slowed down again today after it had seemingly picked pace earlier last week following US' inflation hiking to a 39-year high of seven percent. On January 13, Bitcoin was trading at $43,598 (roughly Rs. 32.2 lakh) on international exchanges. As per industry insiders, the rising popularity of altcoins among investors could pose a challenge to Bitcoin's supremacy. As Bitcoin's prominence begins to waver, BitPay saw a 27 percent drop in merchants processing Bitcoin payments in 2021, and a rise in transactions in stablecoins, Ether and Dogecoin,\u201d the research team of CoinDCX told Gadgets 360. \u201cWith altcoins gaining ground amongst retail investors, we may see other digital assets challenging Bitcoin's pole position and place as a safe haven asset in 2022.\u201d Meanwhile, a bunch of cryptocurrencies did manage to register gains despite the mega ones being hit by losses. Tether , Cardano , USD Coin , Polygon , Chainlink , Uniswap and Litecoin climbed up the price ladder with small but significant gains. The predictions of billionaire business tycoons such as Elon Musk and Mark Cuban spell out a bright future for the crypto sector in the times to come. While Musk has opened payments for Tesla merchandise in DOGE, Cuban recently called Ether the closest crypto asset we have to the existing fiat currencies. The maturing crypto sector is also set to see lesser criminals trying to misuse cryptocurrencies in the near future, a report by research firm Chainalysis said. The study claims that the criminal usage of cryptocurrencies will drop around the world, as more governments learn to take advantage of the uncensored transparency that the blockchain technology offers.

The cryptocurrency was down 5.7% over the previous 24-hour period as of 11:45 a.m. ET. With Bitcoin and Ethereum roughly flat over the previous day of trading and the broader cryptocurrency market looking uncharacteristically stable, Dogecoin's sell-off likely stems from investors taking profits after recent gains. The token began climbing early in the week and posted even bigger gains after Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that his electric-vehicle company would accept DOGE as payment for its merchandise. Now, the popular meme cryptocurrency seems to be taking a breather. Image source: Getty Images. So what Over the last year, Elon Musk has been a Dogecoin holder's best friend. The famous executive has hinted at, and directly expressed, support for the token through Twitter messages and other channels, and his comments have frequently powered impressive gains for the meme-powered cryptocurrency. Even with the recent pullback, Dogecoin is still up roughly 19% over the last seven days. After Musk published a Tweet on Jan. 14 announcing that Dogecoin could be used to purchase Tesla merch, the token's price quickly spiked 25%. While there doesn't appear to be any coin-specific news behind the cryptocurrency's pullback on Sunday, it's not surprising to see Dogecoin give up some ground on the heels of the recent pop. Now what Dogecoin trades down roughly 75% from the lifetime high that it hit last May. Yet, even after recent volatility in the broader cryptocurrency space and substantial draw downs for its token price, the cryptocurrency is still up roughly 1,900% over the last year. Dogecoin Price data by YCharts Dogecoin was started as a campy, dog-themed clone of Bitcoin, but the token went on to deliver seriously impressive returns for investors who got in before its massive pricing surge. The token currently has a market capitalization of roughly $23.6 billion and ranks as the 11th largest cryptocurrency by valuation. While Ethereum, Solana , and Cardano have underlying blockchain service networks that help shape the performance of their respective cryptocurrencies, the pricing drivers for Dogecoin are currently limited to coin adoption and speculation. If more companies begin accepting the token as a payment method or more trading platforms introduce the option to buy and sell the cryptocurrency, that could help to send Dogecoin higher. However, investors should proceed with the understanding that Dogecoin is a high-risk investment, and its trading will likely continue to be highly volatile.","image_url":null,"source_id":"fool"},"3":{"title":"Survey: Proportion of South African Crypto Holders Grows to 11.3%, 56% of Crypto Owners Hold Bitcoin","link":"https:\/\/news.bitcoin.com\/survey-proportion-of-south-african-crypto-holders-grows-to-11-3-56-of-crypto-owners-hold-bitcoin\/","keywords":["Emerging Markets","crypto holders","cryptocurrency ownership","dogecoin","Solana","south africa crypto","XRP"],"creator":["Terence Zimwara"],"video_url":null,"description":"The number of surveyed South Africans that own crypto grew marginally from 10.3% in October 2021, to 11.3% in December 2021.

The price of Dogecoin dropped 2.3% over the past 24 hours, as of 11 a.m. ET. However, this dog-inspired cryptocurrency did hold on to the majority of yesterday's double-digit gains , a net positive for Dogecoin bulls. Yesterday's massive rally, induced by a tweet from Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk who announced that Dogecoin would be accepted for some types of Tesla merch, sent this meme token on its biggest rally in a month. Those shorting this meme token got hurt from this news, with derivatives-linked liquidations totaling nearly $12 million for short-sellers yesterday. Image source: Getty Images. So what Continued volatility for Dogecoin has kept derivatives liquidations relatively high, with $5 million in liquidations reported over the past 24 hours, as per analytics site Coinglass. Derivatives allow for investors to make leveraged bets on short-term price swings in given tokens. Due to the already elevated volatility and risk levels of cryptocurrencies in general and meme tokens in particular, these financial products can often lead to forced liquidations of positions (similar to margin calls in the equities world). Now what Traders don't appear ready to stop trading Dogecoin. The Shiba Inu-inspired token has seen incredible rallies and declines in the past. These short-term swings provide the potential for traders to make a lot of money in a short period of time, or lose in a big way. Over the past two days, losses have mounted, for those taking a bearish view of Dogecoin. Like any volatile asset class, investors should remember to practice discipline in sizing positions appropriately, according to each individual's risk tolerance level. For most, Dogecoin itself is already too risky to consider as a serious investable asset. Dogecoin derivatives take the risk to a whole new level, aimed at the most risk-loving investors out there. Thus, the volatility we're seeing in Dogecoin could potentially be amplified by derivatives-linked buying and selling in the near term. Those looking to invest in this token should be aware of what the short-term price volatility implications are, before diving in.","image_url":null,"source_id":"fool"}},"nextPage":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null}}
